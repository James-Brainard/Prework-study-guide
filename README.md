# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Study Guide was created for myself and my fellow bootcamp students who are attending full-time. The webpage contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript along with some useful tips, along with using Javascript to suggest what we should learn next in DevTools. I believe this will assist myself and others to refer back to while learning. The part I found most useful was how to use Git and coordinate Git with Github.

To use this Study Guide, you can review all bullet points for each section which contains information on HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript. For suggestions on what to study next, open the Chrome Devtools Command+Option+I (MacOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). When the console panel appears either on the side of bottom, you will see a list of topics we learned from Prework along with a suggestion on what to study/reinforce next.
