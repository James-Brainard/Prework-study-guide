        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>There are some HTML elements that do not need to be closed, such as img, hr, and br. </li>
          <li>Everything in the head section is NOT visible to the viewers/users. </li>
          <li>br is used as a page break. When inserting an image it may be better practice to add a br so the following text appears below the image.</li>
          <li>HREF is used to specify the URL of the page the link goes to.</li>
          <li>When adding an image, it is good practice to add a short description of the image in the ALT section for assisted viewers. This also helps if the image cannot load therefor leaving the short description behind.</li>
          <li>Semantic HTML elements include, article, aside, figcaption, footer, header, main, mark, main, section and time.</li>
          <li>The title section in the <strong>head element</strong> enables the title to be viewed on the browers tab.</li>
          <li>The strong tag will make a text <strong>BOLD</strong>. Em will<em> italicize</em> the text.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>You can add a CSS rule to multiple elements in HTML when seperated with a comma. </li>
          <li>Remember the <strong>CSS Box Model</strong> this contains the content in the middle, padding just outside of content, border outside of padding and margin outside of border.</li>
          <li>Padding adds space around the <strong>content</strong> inside an element.</li>
          <li>Margin indicates how much space we want around the <strong>outside</strong> of an element.</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
     <ul>
       <li>Git Workflow consists of editing files in the working directory, adding files to the staging area, and saving changes to a Git repository.</li>
       <li>A Working Directory: where you will be doing all the work: creating, editing, deleting and organizing files.</li>
       <li>A Staging Area: where you will list changes you make to the working directory.</li>
       <li>A Repository: where Git permanently stores those changes as different versions of the project.</li>
       <li>Git init sets up all the tools Git needs to begin tracking changes made to the project.</li>
       <li>Say I made a change and now I want to discard that change? We can do this by using the git checkout file name method. This will restore the file in our working directory to look exactly as it did when we made that last commit.</li>
       <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
     </ul>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
     <ul>
       <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
       <li>Instead of writing out the same code over and over, <strong>Loops</strong> allow us to tell computers to repeat a given block of code on its own.</li>
       <li>A for loop contains 3 parts. The initialization starts the loop, stopping condition is the condition that the iterator variable is evaluated against, everytime it returns true the code is ran, false it stops. Lastely an itreration statement is used to update the iterator such as increasing the number by 1 or decreasing by 1.</li>
       <li>It is possible to loop in reverse. Say your array has 6 items, to do this let i = array.length -1; i >=0; i-- </li>
       <li>While loops allow for different types of stopping conditions.</li>
